1) All evaluations must be done on declared variables in memory --> No expressions in your evaluations
2) All variables that are evaluated must have been expressed in their current value in a system state
3) All model actions can only be done when there is an up-to-do thought outputted of the system state that they will use.


--- This ensures all variables are known ---
--- But how do you do this? ---

3) If you change a variable --> THINK up an event, with a new state. 
4) If you change the model --> THINK with the event that last changed the system state that you have used, action is your model action, no system state.
5) If you evaluate what you're gonna do next --> THINK with the event that last changed the system event that you have used, action is your algorithm action, system state?


--- Rules for thoughts ---
6) If you use the same system state descriptor, you need the same event. 
7) You're allowed not to supply a System State if you know for certain not a single variable of system state has occured.


-------------- Rules for making expressions ------------------
1) If you use an event, you may only use the variables described in the system state for that event
2) 

---- What do System State Descriptors do? ---- 
  



---- Consequences for thought results -----
1) The same event might result in different actions, but all those actions look at the same system state!!



----- Questions I still have ----
- Which variables from a previous system state do you take with you?
	Answer: None.

- Which variables do you set in the System State? The total calculation will evaluate to true false stuff, which will result in a decision tree that exactly explains the algorithm.


Guide to implementing:
1) Write down all variables that change during execution that are being used
2) For each variable, write down the code line numbers where they are being changed.
3) Based on 2, determine the events. What are the big changes to memory? 
4) Make an event dependency graph.
5) Now that you know which evens can take place, ...




----- Random thoughts -----
When transforming the thoughts to an analyzeable format, we should make a column 'last-event', and remove the event lines from the post-formatting file.
